Operation and Rules for the Financial Statement Generator
This section outlines the operation and rules to follow for the financial statement generator. We will also cover the different types of files used to facilitate the process. Each type of file plays a specific role in the declaration and validation of documents. Additionally, we will discuss control rules and the various types of controls implemented to ensure the quality and compliance of the data. This generator takes an Excel file or a submission file as input and produces various output files, including a submission file and verified and non-verified vertical, horizontal, and inter-document rules, as well as a report file.

The diagram illustrates a workflow using an Excel file. Here is a more detailed description:

Excel File (Input): This is the Excel document that serves as the starting point for the process.
For the same input (the Excel file), the generator can produce multiple outputs:

Submission File
Verified and non-verified rules for the three types of rules: vertical, horizontal, and inter-document.
This means that from a single Excel file, the generator can generate four different types of outputs.

The second diagram shows a workflow that processes the submission file:

Submission File (Input)
Report File (Output)
For a single input (Submission File), the generator generates a single output (Report File).
